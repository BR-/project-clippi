* If you are gifted in the way of code, you can help by adding more detectable events and more executable actions. Dive into the docs for the [`slp-realtime` library](https://github.com/vinceau/slp-realtime) which underpins this project and [the source code](https://github.com/vinceau/project-clippi) for the Project Clippi front-end.

## Donations

While I've spent the past several months working on this project from the comfort of my occasionally smokey room, firefighters have been risking their lives for the past several months defending my country. Australia is currently battling the worst bushfires it has ever seen. Almost 15 million acres have been burned, and almost half a billion animals have died or lost their habitat. The air quality has been reaching more than 11 times hazardous levels, at least 25 people have died, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, and that's not the worst of it. **The fire is still burning uncontrollably. Right. Now.**

If you are financially able, please donate to any of the following bushfire relief organisations. **For all donations of $5 or more, I will highly prioritise your feedback and requested features. For all donations of $10 or more, I will also include your name (and/or gamer tag) in a list of Project Clippi supporters to be included in the main page as well as in the app itself.**
