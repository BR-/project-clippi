> A Melee Automation Framework

Project Clippi is an automation framework for Super Smash Bros. Melee. Detect an event â†’ execute an action. Someone did a sick combo? Twitch clip it. A new game is starting? Change OBS scenes. A player died? Play a sound. Everything is open source and fully-customisable. The possibilities are endless.

## Development

After cloning the repo, run the following commands.

```bash
yarn install     # Install all the dependencies
yarn run start   # Start the development server
```

This will automatically start the development server. It includes HMR and
auto-reloading so changes to both the main and renderer processes should
auto-update.
