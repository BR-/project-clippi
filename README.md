# Project Clippi

> An automation framework for Project Slippi


## Development

After cloning the repo, run the following commands.

```bash
yarn install     # Install all the dependencies
yarn run start   # Start the development server
```

This will automatically start the development server. It includes HMR and
auto-reloading so changes to both the main and renderer processes should
auto-update.
