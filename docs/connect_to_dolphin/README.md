# Connecting to Slippi Dolphin

If you are playing games on Slippi Dolphin you can connect to the Dolphin instance to use Clippi Automator.

## 1. Open Slippi Dolphin and start Melee

This is critical. Slippi Dolphin **must** be already running or Clippi **cannot** find the Dolphin instance!

## 2. Setup Project Clippi

Make sure you have the latest version of Project Clippi from [the releases page](https://github.com/vinceau/project-clippi/releases).

Open up the settings page and click "Slippi Connection".

In the right hand panel click the "Find Dolphin Instance" button.

It should now say "Connected" and display the folder underneath.

You should now be ready to start customising different events and actions. Close the settings page and start automating!
