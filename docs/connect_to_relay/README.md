# Connecting to a Slippi Relay

This tutorial assumes that you have Slippi mirroring already set up. If you have not set up Slippi mirroring, follow [the Slippi mirroring guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ezavBjqVGbVO8aqSa5EHfq7ZflrTCvezRYjOf51MOWg/edit) first before following the steps below.

## 1. Setup Slippi Launcher

Make sure you have the [Slippi Launcher](https://slippi.gg/downloads) installed.

Go to the Console Mirror page. Add a connection, or edit an existing connection.

You should now see "Relay Port" section next to your Wii connection. Remember this number since it will be important for later.
