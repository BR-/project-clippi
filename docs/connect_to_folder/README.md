# Connecting to a live SLP folder

> **Disclaimer**: This feature has not been extensively tested. If you encounter issues, tweet @ProjectClippi so we can get this fixed.

If you are playing on Slippi Dolphin, you won't have a relay port you can connect to. Instead you will need to know the location where your SLP files are stored.

Typically your SLP files will be stored in a `Slippi` folder in the same location where your `Dolphin.exe` is.
